SublimeCowsay
=============

A silly little [Sublime Text][1] plugin for 2 and 3 to allow you to quickly convert a text selection to a cow speech bubble via the brilliant `cowsay`
utility:

     ______
    < Moo. >
     ------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||

How to Use
==========

You'll need `cowsay` on your system. It can be installed with the appropriate
one of these terminal commands:

    brew install cowsay
    sudo apt-get install cowsay
    yum install cowsay

Then simply select the text you want cowsayized and run the palette command
**"Cowsay Selected Text"** - and bam.


How to Install
==============

If you don't have PackageControl, [go install it][2] (and don't forget to
restart Sublime.)

Afterwards, go to Preferences->Package Control, pick "Install Package" from the
menu, wait a second and type in "cowsay" to find this package in the list.
Press Enter to confirm installation. That's it!
